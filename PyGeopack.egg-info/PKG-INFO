Description: # PyGeopack
        
        A Python wrapper for Geopack-2008. This includes the T89, T96, T01 and 
        TS05 (or is it TS04? I don't know...) magnetic field models for Earth's
        magnetosphere. See https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/modelweb/magnetos/tsygan.html
        and http://geo.phys.spbu.ru/~tsyganenko/modeling.html for more information.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        The following Python packages will be installed automatically:
        
        * numpy
        * PyFileIO
        * RecarrayTools
        * DateTimeTools
        
        The following packages will also be required for running the 
        ```PyGeopack.UpdateParameters()``` routine:
        
        * kpindex
        * pyomnidata
        
        ## Installation
        
        Firstly a few environment variables need setting up: `$KPDATA_PATH`,
        `$OMNIDATA_PATH` and `$GEOPACK_PATH`, which will point to the Kp index 
        data, the omni data and the Geopack data, respectively. This can be done 
        by including the following in your `~/.bashrc` file, or by running it in 
        the terminal before starting Python:
        
        ```
        export KPDATA_PATH=/path/to/kp
        export OMNIDATA_PATH=/path/to/omni
        export GEOPACK_PATH=/path/to/geopack/data
        ```
        where both of those directories must be writable by the current user, 
        unless the data already exist in them.
        
        Then simply install using pip3:
        
        ```
        pip3 install PyGeopack --user
        ```
        
        or by downloading the latest release on GitHub and running:
        
        ```
        pip3 install PyGeopack-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl --user
        ```
        
        NOTE: You should uninstall any previous versions before installing this. 
        If you had a version installed before 0.0.12 - you will need to 
        remove the old shared object files - they are likely to be contained
        somewhere like (depending on the Python version used):
        
        ```
        ~/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/PyGeopack/
        ```
        It's best just to remove everyting within that folder!
        
        ## Post-install
        
        After installation, the PyGeopack module will attempt to locate the 
        OMNI data required for the models. If these data exist already in
        `$GEOPACK_PATH` then it will load into memory. If they don't exist, then
        the user will be shown a warning - the next section explains how to fix
        this.
        
        ## Usage
        
        There are three main uses for this Python package:
        
        1. Calculating the model magnetic field at any given point in space.
        2. Tracing along the magnetic field.
        3. Coordinate conversions.
        
        Before doing any of the above, it's recommended that you grab the up to 
        date omni parameters - the `UpdateParameters` routine will download and 
        update the Kp index and OMNI parameters, then calculate the G and W 
        parameters required for the models:
        
        ```python
        import PyGeopack as gp
        gp.UpdateParameters(SkipWParameters=True)
        ```
        The `SkipWParameters` keyword (set to `True` by default) can be used to
        skip the lengthy process of calculating the six W parameters for the 
        TS05 magnetic field model - if `True` then these will be filled with 
        zeros. Apparently they aren't all that important anyway. The code 
        included in this module can calculate them and is Tsyganenko's own code,
        but it produces different numbers to those given in the files on
        Tsyganenko's website! No idea why, so use them with caution!
        
        ### 1. Calculating the model field.
        
        To calculate the model field, use the `ModelField` function:
        
        ```python
        Bx,By,Bz = gp.ModelField(x,y,z,Date,ut,Model='T96',CoordIn='GSM',CoordOut='GSM',**kwargs)
        ```
        Where `x`, `y` and `z` are the position(s) you wish to find the magnetic
        field at in R<sub>E</sub> - these can be either scalars or 
        `numpy.ndarray`s. `Date` is the date as an integer, in the format 
        yyyymmdd. `ut` is the time in hours, i.e. `ut = hours + mins/60 + secs/3600`.
        `Model` can be set to one of four strings currently: `'T89'`, `'T96'` 
        (default), `'T01'` or `'TS05'`, more information about the models will 
        be discussed further down in this document. `CoordIn` and `CoordOut`
        denote the input and output coordinate systems, respectively, and can be
        set to one of the three following options: `'GSM'` (default), `'GSE'` or
        `'SM'`. `**kwargs` are discussed in detail in the "Model Parameters" 
        section. `Bx`, `By` and `Bz` are the three components of the magnetic 
        field model in nT for each of the input coordinates.
        
        ### 2. Tracing the magnetic field
        
        Trace along the magnetic field from 1 or more starting positions in the 
        magnetosphere `x`, `y` and `z` using the `TraceField` object:
        
        ```python
        T = gp.TraceField(x,y,z,Date,ut,Model='T96',CoordIn='GSM',CoordOut='GSM',
        		alt=100.0,MaxLen=1000,DSMax=1.0,FlattenSingleTraces=True,Verbose=True,**kwargs)
        ```
        
        `x`, `y` and `z` can either be scalars, or arrays of coordinates in 
        R<sub>E</sub>.
        `Date` can either be a single date, for all traces, or an array of dates
        (one for each trace) where each is an integer in the format yyyymmhh.
        `ut` is the time in hours (i.e. `ut = hours + mins/60`) and can either 
        be a single value for all traces, or an array with a time for each trace.
        `Model` denotes the field model being used - `'T89'`, `'T96'` (default),
        `'T01'` or `'TS05'`.
        `CoordIn` and `CoordOut` denote the input and output coordinate systems, 
        respectively, and can be set to one of the three following options: 
        `'GSM'` (default), `'GSE'` or `'SM'`.
        `alt` is the altitude in km atwhich the trace will be terminated 
        (`alt = 100.0` by default).
        `MaxLen` is the maximum number of steps for the traces (default is 1000).
        `DSMax` is the maximum step length in R<sub>E</sub> (default 1.0).
        `FlattenSingleTraces` if set to `True` will flatten the 2D arrays stored
        in the `TraceField` object if only a single trace is performed.
        `Verbose` is `True` will output the tracing progress to the terminal.
        `**kwargs` will be discussed in the "Model Parameters" section.
        
        The `TraceField` object, `T` in the above code snippet, contains the 
        following arrays:
        
        | | |
        |:--|:---|
        | `x` |		x coordinate along the field trace(s) |
        | `y` |			y coordinate along the field trace(s) |
        | `z` |			z coordinate along the field trace(s) |
        | `Bx` |			x component of the magnetic field along the trace(s) |
        | `By` |			y component of the magnetic field along the trace(s) |
        | `Bz` |			z component of the magnetic field along the trace(s) |	
        | `nstep` |	 	number of steps along the trace(s) |
        | `GlatN` |	 	Geographic latitude of the northern footprint(s) |
        | `GlatS` |		Geographic latitude of the southern footprint(s) |
        | `MlatN` |		Magnetic latitude of the northern footprint(s) |
        | `MlatS` |		Magnetic latitude of the southern footprint(s) |
        | `GlonN` |		Geographic longitude of the northern footprint(s) |
        | `GlonS` |		Geographic longitude of the southern footprint(s) |
        | `MlonN` |		Magnetic longitude of the northern footprint(s) |
        | `MlonS` |		Magnetic longitude of the southern footprint(s) |
        | `GltN` |			Geographic local time of the northern footprint(s) |
        | `GltS` |			Geographic local time of the southern footprint(s) |
        | `MltN` |			Magnetic local time of the northern footprint(s) |
        | `MltS` |			Magnetic local time of the southern footprint(s) |
        | `Lshell` |		L-shell of the field line(s) at the equator |
        | `MltE` |			Magnetic local time of the equatorial footprint(s) |
        | `FlLen` |		Field line length in planetary radii |
        | `R` |			`R = sqrt(x**2 + y**2 + z**2)`	 |
        
        ### 3. Coordinate conversion
        
        This module contains the following Cartesian coordinate conversion
        routines:
        
        ```python
        x1,y1,z1 = gp.GSEtoGSM(x0,y0,z0,Date,ut)
        x1,y1,z1 = gp.GSEtoMAG(x0,y0,z0,Date,ut)
        x1,y1,z1 = gp.GSEtoSM(x0,y0,z0,Date,ut)
        x1,y1,z1 = gp.GSMtoGSE(x0,y0,z0,Date,ut)
        x1,y1,z1 = gp.GSMtoSM(x0,y0,z0,Date,ut)
        x1,y1,z1 = gp.MAGtoGSE(x0,y0,z0,Date,ut)
        x1,y1,z1 = gp.SMtoGSE(x0,y0,z0,Date,ut)
        x1,y1,z1 = gp.SMtoGSM(x0,y0,z0,Date,ut)
        ```
        
        where `x0`, `y0` and `z0` are either scalars or arrays of positions to
        be transformed. `Date`is an integer in the format yyyymmdd and `ut` is
        the time in hours (i.e. `ut = hours + minutes/60.0`). `x1`, `y1` and 
        `z1` are the transformed coordinates.
        
        Also included are the following routines:
        
        ```python
        MLon,MLat = gp.GEOtoMAG(Lat,Lon,Date,ut)
        Lon,Lat = gp.MAGtoGEO(MLat,MLon,Date,ut)
        ```
        which convert between geographic ( `Lat` and `Lon`) and magnetic ( `MLat`
        and `MLon`) latitude and longitudes.
        
        And for converting between magnetic longitude (`MLon`) and magnetic 
        local time (`MLT`):
        
        ```python
        MLT = gp.MLONtoMLT(MLon,Date,ut)
        MLon = gp.MLTtoMLON(MLT,Date,ut)
        ```
        Descriptions of the coordinate systems:
        
        | Name                                  | Description | x        | y | z |
        |:--------------------------------------|:-----------:|:---------|:--|:--|
        | GSE - Geocentric Solar Ecliptic       | fixed       | Towards the Sun | Opposite to Earth's orbit | Perpendicular to the ecliptic plane |
        | GSM - Geocentric Solar Magnetospheric | fixed       | Towards the Sun | | Projection of the dipole axis in the Y-Z GSE plane |
        | SM - Solar Magnetic                   | fixed       | In the plane containing the Earth-Sum line and the dipole axis | | Along the dipole axis |
        | MAG - Geomagnetic                     | rotating    | | Through intersection of magnetic equator and geographic meridian 90 degrees east of the meridian containing the dipole axis | Along the dipole axis |
        | GEO - Geographic                      | rotating    | Through intersection of equator and Greenwich meridian | | Along Earth's rotation axis |
        
        NOTE: By "fixed", I mean that they do not rotate with the Earth's spin, they are not really fixed.
        
        ### Model Parameters
        
        In this section, the parameters and relevant `**kwargs` are discussed 
        for each model. If `**kwargs` aren't used, then the relevant parameters
        are found autmoatically for the date and time provided when using the 
        models. Individual parameters amy be altered without affecting the 
        others - if only a single parameter is changed, then the others are 
        still automatically calculated. The `**kwargs` accepted by `ModelField`
        and `TraceField` are:
        
        | Keyword  | Data Type              | Description                      |
        |:---------|:-----------------------|:---------------------------------|
        | `iopt`   | scalar integer         | iopt=Kp+1 (iopt=7 for Kp>=6)     |  
        | `parmod` | 10-element float array | Elements 0 - 3 are Pdyn, SymH, IMF By and IMF Bz, respectively. Elements 4 - 9 depend on the model |
        | `tilt`   | scalar float           | The dipole tilt angle in radians |
        | `Vx`     | scalar float           | x component of solar wind velocity |
        | `Vy`     | scalar float           | y component of solar wind velocity |
        | `Vz`     | scalar float           | z component of solar wind velocity |
        | `Kp`     | scalar integer         | Kp index                         |
        | `Pdyn`   | scalar float           | Dynamic pressure in nPa          |
        | `SymH`   | scalar float           | SymH in nT                       |
        | `By`     | scalar float           | IMF y component in nT            |
        | `Bz`     | scalar float           | IMF z component in nT            |
        
        All models can be affected by the `Vx`, `Vy`, and `Vz` parameters as 
        these are used to aberrate the coordinates into the GSW frame, where 
        GSW is equivalent to GSM in the situation where `Vy=0` and `Vz=0`. 
        `tilt` is calculated automatically for all models based on the date, 
        time and the IGRF magnetic field model.
        
        #### T89
        
        The only parameter used here is `iopt` which can be controlled with 
        either setting `iopt` or `Kp` keywords to an integer. Valid values for
        `iopt` are integers in the range 1-7, if `Kp` is set, then `iopt` is
        set automatically equal to `Kp+1`. For `Kp`>=6 `iopt=7`.
        
        #### T96
        
        The first four elements of the `parmod` array are used for this model
        where `parmod[0]` is the dynamic pressure, `parmod[1]` is the SymH,
        `parmod[2]` is the y component of the interplanetary magnetic field 
        (IMF) and `parmod[3]` is the z component of the IMF. All other elements
        of this array are ignored. The entire `parmod` array can be set using
        the `parmod` keyword, otherwise individual elements can be edited using
        the `Pdyn`, `SymH`, `By` and `Bz` keywords, where other unchanged 
        parameters will be calculated automatically.
        
        #### T01
        
        This model uses the first six elements of the `parmod` array, where the
        first four are set in exactly the same way as in the T96 model. 
        `parmod[4]` and `parmod[5]` correspond to the G1 and G2 parameters 
        calculated in Tsyganenko, 2002b. These can, I believe, be set to 0.
        
        #### TS05
        
        This model uses all of the `parmod` array, where the first four are as 
        in the T96 model. The last 6 elements are the W1-W6 parameters described
        in Tsyganenko and Sitnov, 2005.
